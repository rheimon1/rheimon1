# Hi there!

I'm Wallace Ramon a Information Systems student at the University of SÃ£o Paulo and passionate about development. I'm currently working on my personal projects here in GitHub and also looking to collaborate on open-source projects. About development, I work more on back-end with languages such as Javascript(Node.js), Java and Python, but I also have experience in front-end in technologies like Javascript(ReactJS).
